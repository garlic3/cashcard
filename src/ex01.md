### Spring
- comprehensive framework that provides various modules for building different types of applications

### Spring Boot
- more opinionated, streamlined version of Spring
- with an embedded web server

### Spring's Inversion of Control Container
-Spring boot allows to configure how and when dependencies are provided to application at runtime
- Spring boot allows to provide an external configuration that specifies how and when such dependencies ard used
- Dependency injection and accompanying frameworks are one way ofr achieving inversion of control, and Spring developers 
will often state that dependencies are "injected" into their applications at runtime

### API Contract & JSON

- how should API consumers interact with the API?
- What data do consumers need to sen in various scenarios?
- What data should the API return to consumers, and when?
- What does the API communicate when it's used incorrectly?

### API Contracts

- Consumer Driven Contracts
- Provider Driven Contracts
- as a formal agreement between a software provider and a consumer that abstractly communicates how to interact
with each other
- This contract defines how API providers and consumers interact, what data exchanges looks like,
and how to communicate success and failure cases
- The provider and consumers only share the same API contracts

### Why Are API Contracts Important?

- API contracts communicate the behavior of a REST API
- provide specific details about the data being serialized(or deserialized) for each command and parameter being exchanged

### Why Is JSON?

- JSON(Javascript Object Notation) provides a data interchange format that represents the particular information of
an object in a format
- When compared to XML(Extensible Markup Language), JSON reads and writes quicker, is easier to use, and takes up less space


### What Is Test Driven Development(TDD)?

- test before implementing the application code
- By asserting expected behavior before implementing the desired functionality, designing the system based on 
what we want it to do, rather than what the system already does
- the tests guide you to write the minimum code needed to satisfy the implementation
- tried-and-true technique to help application developers design simple yet robust software, and guard against functionality
regressions and bugs

### The Testing Pyramid

- Unit Tests : exercises a small "unit" of the system that's isolated from the rest of the system
- a high ratio of Unit Test in testing pyramid, as they're key to designing highly cohesive, loosely coupled software
- Integration Tests : exercise a subset of the system and may exercise groups of units in one test
- They are more complicated to write and maintain, and run slower than unit tests
- End-to-End Tests : exercises the system using the same interface that a user would, such as a web browser
- They can be very slow and fragile because they use simulated user interactions in potentially complicated UIs
- Implement the smallest number of these tests

### The Red, Green, Refactor Loop

- Red : Write a failing test for the desired functionality
- Green : Implement the simplest thing that can work to make the test pass
- Refactor : Look for opportunities to simplify, reduce duplication, or otherwise improve the code without changing 
any behavior to refactor

### REST, CRUD, and HTTP

- REST : Representational State Transfer
- data objects : Resource Representations
- The purpose of RESTful API : to manage the state of these Resources
- CRUD : the four basic perations that can be performed on objects in data store
- In HTTP, a caller sends a Request to a URI -> A web server receives the request, and routes it to a request hanlder 
-> The handler creates a Response, which is then sent back to the caller

- Request : Method(Verb), URI(Endpoint), Body
- Response : Status Code, Body

- For CREATE : POST
- For READ : GET
- For UPDATE : PUT
- For DELETE : DELETE

### The Request Body

- To create or update a resource, we need to submit data to the API

### Spring Annotations and Component Scan

- Spring Beans : objects that Spring configure and instantiate
- Spring Annotation : directs Spring to create an instance of the class during Spring's Component Scan phase
- The Bean is stored in Spring's IoC container

### Spring Web Controllers

- In Spring Web, Requests are handled by Controllers
- @RestController : The Controller gets injected into Spring Web, which routes API requests(handled by the Controller) 
to the correct method

``` 
@RestController 
class CashCardController{
}
 ```

- A Controller method can be designated a handler method, to be called when a request that the method knows how to handle
  (called a "matching request") is receiced

```
private CashCard findById(Long requestId){
}
```

- Read endpoints should use the HTTP GET method
- Spring route requests to the method only on GET requests

```
@GetMapping("/cashcards/{requestedId}")
private CashCard findById(Long requestedId){
}
```

- The parameter name matches the {requestId} text within the @Getmapping parameter,
Spring assign(inject) the correct value to the requestedId variable

```
@GetMappting("/cashcards/{requestedId}")
private CashCard findById(@PathVariable Long requestedId){

}
```

- REST says that the Response needs to contain Body and a Response code of 200(OK)
- ResponseEntity class : provides several utility methods to produce Response Entities

```
@RestController
class CashCardController{
    @GetMapping("/cashcards/{requestedId}")
    private ResponseEntity<CashCard> findById(@PathVariable Long requestId){
        CashCard cashCard = /* */
        return ResponseEntity.ok(cashCard);
    }
}
```

### Controller-Repository Architecture

- The Separation of Concerns principle states that well-designed software should be modular,
with each module having distinct and separate concerns from any other module

- mixing the concerns of Controller, which is an abstraction of a web interface, with the concerns of
reading and writing data to a data store, such as a database
- to enforce data managements separation via the Repository pattern
- Controller : in a layer near the client(as it receives and responds to web requests)
- Repository : in a layer near the data store(as it reads from and writes to the data store)
- The Repository is the interface between the application and the database, and provides a common abstraction for any
database, making it easier to switch to a different database when needed

- API Clients(Web browsers, apps, other applications) 
-> Controller(Communications Interface Layer) 
-> Other Layers(Business logic) 
-> Persistence Layer(Repositories) 
-> Data Store

### Choosing a database

- Embedded : it's a java library, so it can be added to the project just like any other dependency
- In-memory : it stores data in memory only, as opposed to persisting data in permanent, durable storage


### Spring Data's CrudRepository

- Spring Data takes care of this implementation for us during the IoC container startup time
- The Spring runtime will then expose the repository as yet another bean that you can reference wherever needed in application

```
interface CashCardRepository extends CrudRepository<CashCard, Long> {

}
```

### Implementing POST

- Who specifies the ID - the client, or the server?
- In the API Request, how do we represent the object to be created?
- Which HTTP method should we use in the Requests?
- What does the API send as a Response?

### Idempotence and HTTP

- Idempotence operation : as one which, if performed more than once, results in the same outcome
- In REST API, an idempotent operation is one that even if it were to be performed several times, the resulting data on
the server would be the same as if it had been performed only once
- GET, PUT, DELETE : idempotent
- POST, PATCH : not idempotent
- REST permits POST as one of the proper methods to use for Create operations

### The POST Request and Response

- Request : Method(POST), URI(/cashcards/), Body({amount:123.45})

- 201 CREATED status : the API is specifically communicating that data was added to the data store on the server
- The HTTP standard specifies that the Location header in a 201 CREATED response should contain the URI of created resource
- This is handy because it allows the caller to easily fetch the new resource using the GET endpoint
- Response : Status Code(201 CREATED), Header(Location=/cashcards/42)

### Spring Web Convenience Methods

- created() method
```
return ResponseEntity.created(uriOfCashCard).build();
```

```
return ResponseEntity
        .status(HttpStatus.CREATED)
        .header(HttpHeaders.LOCATION, uriOfCashCard.toASCIIString())
        .build();
```
